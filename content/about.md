I’m a CS undergrad who loves building and breaking things. I’m an optimist who believes coding can solve just about anything.
You’ll usually find me coding, but when I’m not, I’m either reading a book, watching a movie, or playing Valorant.

I’m currently learning `Elixir` and creating most of my projects in `Go` or `Python`. Recently, I started reading **Black Hat Bash**
to dive deeper into scripting and hacking.

I’m always eager to learn new things and open to collaboration. If you have any questions, suggestions, or potential work opportunities,
feel free to reach out to me at nisargkhodke@gmail.com.
