# [Yolo! Nisarg this side!](https://github.com/Nisarg2061)

A CS undergrad and a total Linux geek.
Though not so great, I can code and dabble in a bit of reverse engineering.

BTW, this is [`ZeroDay`](https://github.com/Nisarg2061/ZeroDay) — a website I’m building as
a vault to store all the info about the projects I’m currently working on
(or plan to work on in the future) because, well... I forget stuff a lot, lol.

**Let the journey begin!!**
